# PhotoFrame Support Application

## Overview

Welcome to the PhotoFrame Support Application! This application was developed with the purpose of allowing users to easily insert a frame into their photos, symbolizing their support for a particular cause or campaign. Adding a frame to your photo is a powerful way to visually express solidarity and raise awareness for various social issues, movements, or charitable causes.

This code is based on the [react-image-cropper](https://github.com/OneLightWebDev/react-image-cropper) project and has been customized to meet the specific requirements of the PhotoFrame Support Application.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy for individuals of all skill levels to use.
- **Customization Options**: Personalize your framed photo by adjusting the size, position, and orientation of the frame.

- **High-Quality Output**: The application ensures that the final result is a high-quality photo with a seamlessly integrated frame, suitable for sharing on social media, printing, or other platforms.

## How to Use

1. **Upload Your Photo**: Start by uploading the photo to which you want to add a frame. You can either select a photo from your device's gallery or capture a new one using the in-app camera.

2. **Preview and Save**: Preview the final composition before saving the edited photo. Once satisfied, save the image to your device.

3. **Share and Raise Awareness**: Share your framed photo on social media, messaging apps, or other platforms to amplify the message behind the cause you're supporting.
